  pc: `
  I'm using a laptop with the following specs: 
  <ul>
    <li>Intel Core i5-10750H</li>
    <li>NVIDIA RTX 2060</li>
    <li>16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I learn to code on this laptop, play games, and do some other stuff. I learn mostly in JavaScript/TypeScript, C# these days for web development. I also have a little knowledge of Python and PHP. I also like Golang, I will be spending a lot of time on it in the near future. Anyway, regardless of the language, I just like programming.</p>
